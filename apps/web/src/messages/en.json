  "home.philosophy.heading": "Philosophy",
  "home.philosophy.p1": "Most projects don't fail because of the technology. They fail because expectations weren't aligned, requirements stayed unclear, and nobody said so until it was expensive. The best technical work in the world doesn't matter if the team isn't communicating honestly.",
  "home.philosophy.p2": "My view of clean code has sharpened over two decades: it's not a checklist to enforce — it's a set of principles to understand deeply enough to break wisely. Velocity is the goal. Clean architecture is how you sustain it without accumulating a debt that eventually stops you from shipping at all.",
  "home.philosophy.p3": "I use AI to learn new things and let agents handle what I already know — freeing my attention for what actually needs judgment. The part that surprises most people: the clean code practices that went out of fashion are exactly what make AI collaboration effective. When you can read patterns across any stack and ask precise questions, you steer the agent rather than just prompt it. AI amplifies expertise. It doesn't substitute for it.",
  "home.philosophy.quote": "Clean code is not about purity. It's about understanding the rules well enough to break them for the right reasons — and building systems that stay honest under pressure, ship with confidence, and don't punish the next person.",
  "home.cta.heading": "Your team has the talent. Let's remove what's slowing them down.",
  "home.cta.lead": "Whether it's a legacy codebase, slow delivery cycles, or team dynamics that need a reset — let's talk about what's actually in the way.",

  "me.about.heading": "About me",
  "me.about.p1": "I've been writing code professionally since 2008, across 19 engagements at companies ranging from BMW and Lufthansa to early-stage startups. I started as a fullstack developer and have spent the last decade progressively taking on architectural and leadership scope — not because it was a career plan, but because the problems that interested me kept expanding beyond the code.",
  "me.about.p2": "Today I work as an independent consultant, embedded in engineering teams at DACH enterprises. My focus is the intersection of technical architecture, team dynamics, and delivery — the three things that, in my experience, determine whether a project succeeds or stalls. I run my own Kubernetes cluster, build with AI daily, and have a particular interest in the old-school software principles that turn out to make you a more effective engineer in the AI era, not a less relevant one.",
